# unimed_dsc_app

This project is part of the DSC Solution challenge. It is a rough draft for an app which allows users to search for different medical conditions. The app would provide detailed definitions of these medical conditions, while also offering these definitions in different languages. This solution attempted to address DSC's goals of education and healthcare and well-being.
